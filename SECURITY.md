# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please [privately report it via the Security tab](https://github.com/SergkeiM/vite-plugin-s3/security/advisories/new) on the correct GitHub repository (see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)). If that is impossible, feel free to send an email to **sergio11of@gmail.com** instead.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed. 

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of vite-plugin-s3 and other dependencies by maintaining lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`) in order to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
